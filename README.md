# bootsApp

A dazzling new shop, the Boots Bootique, is set to open their flagship store on Spring Street this spring. However, they’ve got no way to manage all their inventory just yet! The store owns a vast collection of boots of all different sizes, types, materials, and quantities. Help the shop create their inventorying system in time for their shop’s opening.

For this project, we won’t have to touch the code in the frontend. All that we’ll do is use Spring Data JPA to complete the functionality for the Boots API so that the frontend can:

Create new boots
Read and search the boots in the inventory
Update the number of any given boot in the inventory
Delete boots from the inventory
The controller has already been implemented for all the endpoints that the frontend depends on. All you’ll need to do is fill out the model and add in the correct calls to your repository interface methods.
